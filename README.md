# GMM-Gaussian-mixture-models-in-matlab
THis routine is implemented in Matlab

## Requirement:
Matlab2012b or its latest version

## Description:
This rontine using the algorithm of `Gaussian mixture model(GMM)-in EM algorithm` to cluster the dataset. In this routine, I cluster the database into four clusters and draw it in the image.

* The `Bayesian information criterion(BIC)` score and `The Estimation of Maximum Likelihood(MLE)` score is shown in the end.

## Usage:
* Download the whole rontine. Make sure `Database.dat` and `GMM_Matlab.m` are in the same folder.
* Run `GMM_Matlab.m` directly.
